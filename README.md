Algorithm testbed
=================

This repository contains the implementations of different algorithms
solving the same problem, as well as performance and correctness testing
of these implementations.

* find is for an algorithm that finds the first position in an array with unique, sorted integers where the element is larger or equal to the searched key.
* nal contains tests for faster algorithms that read a string from stdin with no arbitrary limits.

Building
